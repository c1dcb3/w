**Category:** osint

**Points:** 200

**Tags:** OSINT

### Description:

She sent me another picture. Can you tell me the name of the tower on top of the red industrial building?

Flag format: {name-of-the-tower}

### Resources:

**File:** ish-osint-m.JPG (ada9c81ff63a92bcaa098f41d8c68311)

### Hint:

She said: "They worked like moles."

### Solution

The image displays a picture taken from inside a car. On the side there's a building with a tower on top.

Crop the image to keep only the building and the tower and perform an image reverse search on bing.

Within the results there are different pages with the name of the factory.
